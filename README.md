# Hand-Detector-Code-Bar-Using-OpenCV-Mediapipe
####  This project will detect hand landmarks, calculate the distance between specific points (e.g., thumb tip and index finger tip), and use that information to control a virtual bar displayed on the screen.
### Below is a step-by-step guide to create a hand detector control bar project using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
*Step 1: Set Up Your Environment*

* Install the required libraries:
  
*pip install mediapipe opencv-python*

**Import necessary modules in your Jupyter Notebook:**

*Step 2: Initialize Hand Tracking*

*Step 3: Create Helper Functions*

*Step 4: Hand Tracking Loop*

*Step 5: Run and Test*
**Run the code and test the hand detector control bar. Open your Jupyter Notebook, execute the cells, and observe the distance displayed on the screen as you move your hand.**
